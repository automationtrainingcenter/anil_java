 * Loops are used to execute a block of statements repeatedly based on some
 * condition. Each and every repetition is known as an iteration.
 * 
 * Java contains mainly 4 loops
 * 1. while 
 * 2. do while
 * 3. for
 * 4. for each
 * here for each loop is used to iterate over a collection of data like 
 * arrays, It is not condition based loop
 * 
 * every loop (except for each) contains mainly 3 parts
 * 1. initialization
 * 2. condition or expression
 * 3. increment or decrement
 * 
 *while loop:
 *
 *initialize;
 *
 *while(condition or expression){
 *	statements which we want to repeat;
 *	increment or decrement
 *}
 *
 *the minimum number of iterations in while loop is 0
 *
 *do while loop:
 *
 *initialize;
 *
 *do{
 *	statements we want to repeat
 *	increment or decrement
 *}
 *while(condition or expression);
 *the minimum number of iterations in while loop is 1
 *
 *
 *for loop:
 *
 *for(initialization; condition or expression; increment or decrement){
 *	statements we want to repeat;
 *}
 *the minimum number of iterations in for loop is 0
 *
 *for each loop:
 *
 *for(collection_data_type var_name : collection_varaible_name){
 *	statements to repeat;
 *}
 *
 *the minimum number of iterations in while loop is 0
