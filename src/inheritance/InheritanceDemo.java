/*
 * Inheritance means acquiring the properties and behavior (methods) of one class (parent or super or base)in 
 * another class (child or sub). The main advantage of Inheritance is code re-usability
 * 
 * There are 5 types of inheritance in OOP
 * 
 * single: single parent and single child                                                          . A -> B
 * multilevel: parent and child and sub child. A->B->C
 * Hierarchical: single parent and multiple child. A->B A->C
 * multiple: multiple parent and single child. A->C B->C
 * Hybrid: combination hierarchical and multiple. 
 * 
 * 
 * multiple and hybrid inheritance is not possible directly in Java.
 * 
 * Inside the child class we can access Parent class properties and methods directly and outside the child class
 * By creating a child class object we can access parent class properties and methods
 * 
 * To achieve inheritance we have to use extends keyword
 * 
 * child class extends parent class
 * 
 * super keyword always represents the parent class instance. 
 * 
 * if a Parent class have a parameterized constructor only then child class must 
 * contain a parameterized constructor which will call the Parent class constructor
